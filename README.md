Agentic Retrieval System
This project implements an Agentic Retrieval System using Azure AI Search and Azure OpenAI to deliver intelligent, context-aware responses for chat applications. The system leverages a hybrid search approach, combining vector search (using HNSW) and keyword search (using BM25), enhanced by an LLM-driven query breakdown for superior retrieval performance. It is built with FastAPI for a high-performance API and supports session-based conversation history.
The source code is available at https://github.com/Prashant-Mouritech/Agentic-Retriever.
Features

Agentic Retrieval: Dynamically breaks down complex queries into subqueries using an LLM, improving relevance for multi-part questions.
Hybrid Search: Combines vector search (HNSW algorithm) for semantic understanding and keyword search (BM25 algorithm) for exact matches.
Session Management: Maintains conversation history in-memory for context-aware responses.
FastAPI Integration: Provides a scalable, async API for handling chat requests.
Azure AI Search: Leverages enterprise-grade search capabilities for efficient document retrieval.
Azure OpenAI: Uses models like gpt-4o-mini for subquery generation and answer synthesis.
Logging: Tracks system activity with timestamps in IST (Asia/Kolkata) for debugging and monitoring.
Cost Efficiency: Built without Azure Foundry, using standard Azure services to minimize costs.

Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure the following are installed and configured:

Python 3.8+
Azure Account with access to:
Azure AI Search
Azure OpenAI (for embeddings and chat completions)


Dependencies:
fastapi
uvicorn
python-dotenv
azure-search-documents
azure-core
openai
pydantic
typing



Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/Prashant-Mouritech/Agentic-Retriever.git
cd Agentic-Retriever


Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Create a requirements.txt file with the following content:
fastapi==0.103.0
uvicorn==0.23.2
python-dotenv==1.0.0
azure-search-documents==11.4.0
azure-core==1.29.4
openai==1.10.0
pydantic==2.4.2


Set Up Environment Variables:Create a .env file in the project root with the following variables:
AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT="your_azure_search_endpoint"
AZURE_SEARCH_API_KEY="your_azure_search_api_key"
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY="your_azure_openai_api_key"
AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_ENDPOINT="your_azure_openai_embedding_endpoint"
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION="2024-02-15-preview"
AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME="text-embedding-ada-002"
AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"
EMBEDDING_VECTOR_DIM=1536

Replace placeholders (e.g., your_azure_search_endpoint) with actual values from your Azure services.

Configure Azure AI Search Index:

Ensure an index named genai-book-index exists in your Azure AI Search instance.
The index should include fields like id, file_name, file_url, chunk, content, lastModifiedDateTime, lastModifiedBy, source, metadata, and embedding (for vector search).



Usage

Run the Application:
python main.py

This starts the FastAPI server on http://0.0.0.0:8000.

Access the API:

Endpoint: POST /chat
Request Body (JSON):{
  "user_question": "Your question here",
  "source_filter": null,
  "conversation_history": null,
  "erase_conversation_history": false
}


Example Request:curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/chat" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"user_question": "How do I set up a project?", "source_filter": null, "conversation_history": null, "erase_conversation_history": false}'


Response:{
  "answer": "Response based on retrieved documents",
  "citations": [
    {
      "file_name": "doc1.pdf",
      "file





//   Example Response:    à´¸
   Example Response:
{
  "answer": "To set up a project, follow these steps: ...",
  "citations": [
    {
      "file_name": "project_management.pdf",
      "file_url": "https://example.com/doc1.pdf",
      "lastModifiedDateTime": "2023-10-01T12:00:00Z",
      "lastModifiedBy": "Admin",
      "source": "Internal"
    }
  ],
  "conversation_history": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "How do I set up a project?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "To set up a project, follow these steps: ..."
    }
  ]
}


Features in Action:
The system breaks down complex queries into subqueries using the LLM.
Hybrid search combines HNSW (vector search) and BM25 (keyword search) for optimal results.
Conversation history is stored in-memory and saved to a file when a session is reset.



How It Works

Query Processing:

The generate_subqueries function uses Azure OpenAI to split complex queries into focused subqueries.
Example: "How do I set up a project and manage its timeline?" becomes ["project setup", "timeline management"].


Hybrid Search:

Vector Search: Uses HNSW algorithm for semantic similarity, powered by embeddings from text-embedding-ada-002.
Keyword Search: Uses BM25 algorithm for exact term matching.
Result Fusion: Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) merges results from both searches, prioritizing high-ranking documents.


Response Generation:

Retrieved documents are synthesized into a context, and the LLM generates a cohesive answer.
Results include citations with metadata (e.g., file name, URL, source).



Why Agentic Retrieval?
This system outperforms traditional search methods by:

Breaking Down Queries: Handles multi-part questions effectively.
Parallel Execution: Runs subqueries simultaneously for efficiency.
Semantic Reranking: Ensures the most relevant results are prioritized.
Cost Efficiency: Built without Azure Foundry, using standard Azure services to reduce costs.
